Python Library: TensorFlow

  Finally released to the public in 2015, TensorFlow is a Python library tailored towards machine learning that was created by Google back in 2009. It is easy for anyone who is looking to learn about machine learning and neural networks to start with this library, as it is free and open-source. In October of this year, TensorFlow 2.0 was released. In this paper we will discuss the history of TensorFlow and important and interesting applications of this python library.

  We chose TensorFlow because it is an up and coming library for machine learning. TensorFlow has already been widely accepted as the standard for machine learning and neural networks since its release in 2015. TensorFlow offers varying levels of abstraction, so it can be applied to a variety of sizes of problem. This makes TensorFlow easily scalable and useful for a variety of tasks within the machine learning discipline. Due to TensorFlows varied and useful applications, more research was required to narrow down important and specific uses. 

  TensorFlow has had quite the history in its 5 years of public release. It was originally created for internal system use at Google by Jeff Dean, who also created the Google Brain team. From the Google Brain team of Jeff Dean, Greg Carrado and Andrew Ng arrose a library called DistBelief. Originally called DistBelief, TensorFlow was renamed in the second generation (possibly to avoid confusion and be slightly more catchy). It was released for Linux, Mac OS and Windows, as well as Android and iOS. In 2018, a TensorFlow for the Javascript library was released. In 2016,  Google created Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which were hardware chips built specifically for an optimized performance of TensorFlow and running models. Later in 2016, TensorFlow Lite for mobile development was released.
TensorFlow is a great option for artificial intelligence projects. It was created with machine learning and neural networks in mind, and as such, when combined with the Keras API it is very easy to use; as easy as calling “Model()”. It’s main use is for image captioning software, such as DeepDream, which is a computer vision program created by Google. It has many interesting use cases in it’s years of release. Some examples of using TensorFlow are Airbnb, which uses TensorFlow to classify images and objects from photos from their listings to improve guest experiences. It can then use these classified images to caption the photos of the rooms. Coca-Cola uses TensorFlow to implement proof of purchase on their mobile app. Kakao uses TensorFlow to predict the completion of ride-hailing requests when sending out drivers. 

	TensorFlow is a great resource for artificial intelligence projects. If you are looking to learn TensorFlow, Google offers many free tutorials on the TensorFlow library, which can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/learn.
