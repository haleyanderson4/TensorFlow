Python Library: TensorFlow

  TensorFlow is a Python library that was created by Google in 2009 and released to the public in 2015. It is free and open-source, so it is easy for anyone who is looking to learn about machine learning and neural networks to start with this library. In October of this year, TensorFlow 2.0 was released. In this paper we will discuss the history of TensorFlow and important and interesting applications of this python library.
  
  We chose TensorFlow because it is an up and coming library for machine learning. TensorFlow has already been widely accepted as the standard for machine learning and neural networks since its release in 2015. TensorFlow offers varying levels of abstraction, so it can be applied to a variety of sizes of problem. This makes TensorFlow easily scalable and useful for a variety of tasks within the machine learning discipline. Due to TensorFlows varied and useful applications, we decided to further study this library. 

  TensorFlow has had a quiet history in its 5 year of public release. It was originally created for internal system use at Google by Jeff Dean, who created the Google Brain team. The Google Brain team of Jeff Dean, Greg Carrado, and Andrew Ng created TensorFlow. It was originally called DisBelief, but was renamed to TensorFlow in the second generation of the library. It was released for Linux, Mac OS and Windows, as well as Android and iOS. In 2018, a TensorFlow for Javascript library was released. In 2016,  Google created Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which is a hardware chip built specifically for an optimized performance of TensorFlow and running models. In 2016, TensorFlow Lite for mobile development was released.

  TensorFlow is a great option for artificial intelligence projects. 

  TensorFlow is a great resource for artificial intelligence projects. If you are looking to learn TensorFlow, Google offers many free tutorials on the TensorFlow library, which can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/learn.
